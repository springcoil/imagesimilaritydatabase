# Image Similarity 
* A simply image similarity algorithm.
* Based on the cool blog post by Tom Hunger [https://blog.wearewizards.io/how-to-build-a-simple-imageprimary-colour-similarity-database](Simple ImagePrimaryColour Similarity database) 
* Similar colours in the context of fashion. 

* Simple IPython notebook

* I used wget to get the images from Zalando.co.uk for this piece of work.
